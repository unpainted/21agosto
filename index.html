                <p class=".quicksand">Last month, “ATE” debuted at No. 1 on Billboard’s Top 200 Albums chart, making Stray Kids the first group in Billboard 200 history to have their first five charting albums enter the chart at No. 1.</p>
                <p class=".quicksand">On August 20 local time, Billboard revealed that “ATE” was now spending its fourth consecutive week on the Billboard 200 at No. 22, marking the highest ranking achieved by a Stray Kids album in its fourth week on the chart.</p>
                <p class=".quicksand">“ATE” is now Stray Kids’ first album to spend four weeks in row in the top 22 of the Billboard 200. (While the group’s 2023 album “★★★★★ (5-STAR)” also spent four weeks in the top 22 of the chart last year, they were non-consecutive.)</p>
